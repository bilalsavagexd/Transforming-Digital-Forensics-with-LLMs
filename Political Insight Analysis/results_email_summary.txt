In a discussion about arrangements on settlements with Israel, two options are presented:

1. Describe it as an agreement, which would raise concerns about legitimizing Israeli activity in the West Bank and triggering complaints from Arabs and Palestinians.

2. The administration could acknowledge progress made, express differences with the Israeli government on their intention to complete housing units, and stress that substantial progress warrants the resumption of peace talks and Arab steps toward Israel for a two-state solution. This option maintains credibility and allows for forward movement.

- Construction of new settlement units in Har Homa, just days after Netanyahu announced the freeze in November 2009, shows that Netanyahu authorized the building of new settlement units.

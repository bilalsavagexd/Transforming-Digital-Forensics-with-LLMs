# Transforming Digital Forensics with Large Language Models

## Overview

In the pursuit of justice and accountability in the digital age, the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with digital forensics holds immense promise. This three-hour tutorial provides a comprehensive exploration of the transformative potential of LLMs in automating digital investigations and uncovering hidden insights.

Through a combination of real-world case studies, interactive exercises, and hands-on labs, participants will gain a deep understanding of how to harness LLMs for evidence analysis, entity identification, and knowledge graph reconstruction.

By fostering a collaborative learning environment, this tutorial aims to empower professionals, researchers, and students with the skills and knowledge needed to drive innovation in digital forensics. As LLMs continue to revolutionize the field, this tutorial will have far-reaching implications for enhancing justice outcomes, promoting accountability, and shaping the future of digital investigations.

### Profiling Suspects

Suspect Profiling from Browser History using LLMs
This module focuses on profiling user behavior based on their browser history by leveraging large language models (LLMs) for natural language reasoning and analysis. It serves as an intelligent layer in a larger digital forensics or user modeling pipeline, where the goal is to infer personal traits, interests, and habits from online activity logs.

The process begins with a preprocessing stage, where raw browser history is cleaned and transformed. This includes removing non-informative URLs (e.g., Google home, system-level domains) and converting relevant entries into a readable format. Timestamps and titles are preserved to maintain temporal context.

Once the data is prepared, it is passed through a LangChain-driven pipeline that interacts with Google Gemini, a powerful LLM capable of drawing nuanced inferences. The browsing history is fed into the model as a structured prompt—formatted as a chronological list of visited pages. The LLM is instructed to behave like a psychological analyst and produce a profile that outlines the user’s likely interests (e.g., gaming, finance, health), behavioral traits (e.g., focused, distracted, nocturnal), and potential demographic indicators (e.g., student, working professional).

We utilize LangChain to orchestrate prompt templates and model calls, providing flexibility and modularity. Gemini is used for its high-level reasoning ability and coherence in text generation, enabling it to infer abstract traits from concrete patterns.

 **This profiling module is applicable in various contexts:**

- Digital Forensics – To support preliminary behavioral analysis during cyber investigations.

- Wellness and Safety Tools – For detecting shifts in online behavior that may suggest mental health risks or harmful activity.

- Adaptive Personalization – To enable smarter personalization without traditional tracking or invasive data collection.

This component illustrates how LLMs can be effectively integrated into user analysis workflows, offering a non-invasive yet insightful method of behavioral profiling.

### Political Insight Analysis Leveraging LLMs

The case study demonstrates how to Leverage Large Language Models to gain political insight based on an email dataset. The dataset we have used in the case study is a set of leaked [emails](https://github.com/benhamner/hillary-clinton-emails?tab=readme-ov-file) obtained from Hillary Clinton's private email server.

The background of the leaked emails is a significant chapter in recent U.S. political history, involving questions of transparency, security, and the handling of sensitive information. During Hillary's tenure as U.S. Secretary of State from 2009 to 2013, Hillary Clinton used a private email server for her official communications instead of the official State Department email system. She stated that this was done for convenience, allowing her to use a single device for both personal and official emails.

The leaked email dataset from Hillary Clinton's private email server is a comprehensive collection of communications covering her entire tenure as Secretary of State from 2009 to 2013. It includes approximately 30,000 emails with a wide range of topics from official diplomatic communications to personal correspondences. The release and subsequent analysis of these emails have played a crucial role in political debates, legal inquiries, and public discussions about transparency and security in government communications.

Our datase ia set of email summaries of Hilary's. Each email summary is a summarization of an email generated by Gemini from an original email in the original leaked [email dataset](https://github.com/benhamner/hillary-clinton-emails?tab=readme-ov-file). We are only interested in emails containing the keyword "Israel".
